# Littlest Isomorph

The goal of Littlest Isomorph is to be a shell for an Isomorphic JavaScript
application with as little internal code as possible.

## Philosophy

- Configuration over Convention
- Simple modules
- Small API surface area

## Features

- HTML5 History-friendly links
- Isomorphic rendering with React
- Isomorphic routing with Routr
- CommonJS via Browserify

## Usage

For an example app that doubles as a great starting point for Littlest Isomorph
projects, take a look at [the Yeoman Generator][generator]

## To-Do

- A simple Flux dispatcher.
- Base class for simple Stores.

## Alternatives

- [Rendr][rendr]: A Backbone-based isomorphic front layer produced by Airbnb.
