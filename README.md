# Littlest Isomorph

A toolkit for building isomorphic applications using JavaScript and React,
including solutions for navigation, routing, rendering, and (most importantly)
contextualized Store state. _Part of the [Littlest][littlest] family._

## Philosophy

- Configuration over Convention
- Simple modules
- Small API surface area

## Features

- HTML5 History-friendly links
- Isomorphic rendering with React
- Isomorphic routing with Routr
- Isomorphic data binding mixin
- Contextualized Store state using [Littlest Dispatcher][dispatcher]

## Usage

For an example app that doubles as a great starting point for Littlest Isomorph
projects, take a look at [the Yeoman Generator][generator]

## Alternatives

- [Rendr][rendr]: A Backbone-based isomorphic front layer produced by Airbnb.
